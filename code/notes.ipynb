    "There are several excellennt modules for doing Bayesian statistics in Python, incluidng ```pymc``` and ```OpenBUGS```.\n",
    "I chose not to use them for this book because you need a fair amount of background knowledge to get started with these modules, and I want to keep the prerequisites minimal. If you know Python and a little bit about probability, you are ready to start this book.\n",

    "\n",
    "Chapter 1 is about probability and Baye's theorem; it has no code. Chapter 2 introduces ```Pmf```, a thinly disguised Python dictionary I use to represent a probablity mass function (PMF). Then Chapter 3 introduces ```Suite```, a kind of Pmf that provides a framework for doing Bayesian updates. And that's just about all there is to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, almost. In some of the later chapters, I use analytic distributions including the Guassian (normal) distribution, the exponential and Poisson distributions, and the beta distribution. In Chapter 15 I break out the less-common Dirichlet distribution, but I explain it as I go along. If you are not familiar with these distributions, you can read about them on Wikipedia. "
