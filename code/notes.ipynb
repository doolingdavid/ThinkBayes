    "To make any progress on the locomotive problem we had to make assumptions, and some of them were pretty arbitrary. In particular, we chose a uniform prior from 1 to 1000, without much justification for choosing 1000, or for choosing a uniform distribution.\n",
    "It is not crazy to believe that a railroad company might operate 1000 locomotives, but a reasonable person might guess more or fewer. So we might wonder whether the posterior distribution is sensitive to these assumptions. With so little data—only one observation—it probably is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that with a uniform prior from 1 to 1000, the mean of the posterior is 333. With an upper bound of 500, we get a posterior mean of 207, and with an upper bound of 2000, the posterior mean is 552.\n",

    "* get more background information\n",

    "With some effort, we could probably find a list of companies that operates locomotives in the area of observation. Or we could interview an expert in rail shipping to gather information about the typical size of companies.\n",

    "## The German tank problem\n",
    "\n",
    "During World War II, the Economic Warfare Division of the American Embassy in London used statistical analsys to estimate German production of tanks and other equpment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Western Allies had captured log books, inventories, and repair records that included chassis and engine serial numbers for individual tanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of these records indicated that serial numbers were allocated by manufacturer and tank tyhpe in blocks of 100 numbers, that numbers in each block were used sequentially, and that not all members in each block were used. So the problem of estimating German tank production could be reduced, within each block fo 100 numbers, to a form of the locomotive problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this insight, American and British analysts produced estimates substantially lower than estimates from other forms of intelligence. And after the war, records indicated that they were substantially more accurate.\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Among Bayesians, there are two approaches to choosing prior distributions. Some recommend choosing the prior that best represents background information about the problem; in that case the prior is said to be informative. The problem with using an informative prior is that people might use different background information (or interpret it differently). So informative priors often seem subjective.\n",
    "The alternative is a so-called uninformative prior, which is intended to be as unrestricted as possible, in order to let the data speak for themselves. In some cases you can identify a unique prior that has some desirable property, like representing minimal prior information about the estimated quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uninformative priors are appealing because they seem more objective. But I am generally in favor of using informative priors. Why? First, Bayesian analysis is always based on modeling decisions. Choosing the prior is one of those decisions, but it is not the only one, and it might not even be the most subjective. So even if an uninformative prior is more objective, the entire analysis is still subjective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, for most practical problems, you are likely to be in one of two regimes: either you have a lot of data or not very much. If you have a lot of data, the choice of the prior doesn’t matter very much; informative and uninformative priors yield almost the same results. We’ll see an example like this in the next chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if, as in the locomotive problem, you don’t have much data, using relevant background information (like the power law distribution) makes a big difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if, as in the German tank problem, you have to make life-and-death decisions based on your results, you should probably use all of the information at your disposal, rather than maintaining the illusion of objectivity by pretending to know less than you do."

    "In Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms, David MacKay poses this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistical statement appeared in “The Guardian\" on Friday January 4, 2002:\n",
    "When spun on edge 250 times, a Belgian one-euro coin came up heads 140 times and tails 110. ‘It looks very suspicious to me,’ said Barry Blight, a statistics lecturer at the London School of Economics. ‘If the coin were unbiased, the chance of getting a result as extreme as that would be less than 7%.’\n",
    "But do these data give evidence that the coin is biased rather than fair?\n",
    "To answer that question, we’ll proceed in two steps. The first is to estimate the probability that the coin lands face up. The second is to evaluate whether the data support the hypothesis that the coin is biased.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ou can download the code in this section from http://thinkbayes.com/euro.py. For more information see Section 0.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any given coin has some probability, x, of landing heads up when spun on edge. It seems reasonable to believe that the value of x depends on some physical characteristics of the coin, primarily the distribution of weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a coin is perfectly balanced, we expect x to be close to 50%, but for a lopsided coin, x might be substantially different. We can use Bayes’s theorem and the observed data to estimate x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s define 101 hypotheses, where Hx is the hypothesis that the probability of heads is x%, for values from 0 to 100. I’ll start with a uniform prior where the probability of Hx is the same for all x. We’ll come back later to consider other priors.\n",
